Is the question about the color of the wall this is completey ok. Is the question about vast consequences like in the case of the corona vaccination the decision making should be as rational as possible. We should consider all relevant information.\nEspecially if we have to handle with little occurrence probability intuitiv decisions may cheat us. It is hard to distinguish between a 0,001 percent and a 0,00001 percent occurrence probability although one is 100 times more likely. For us both are _very unlikely_.\nWhat our tool is doing is simple probability calculation. Since stochastics wasn't the highlight of everyones math lessons we want to explain how the tool and calculations behind are working."

          "text_1": "We assume that someone is offering a little bet: A coin is flipped, if it shows heads we get 10,- Euros, if it shows tails we get nothing. The two possibilities - heads or tails - are named _scenarios_. We ignore the option that the coin can land on its edge. Both scenarios have a probability of 50%. In our tool this situation looks like this:",
          "text_2": "An occurrence probability of 50% means that the respective option will occur in 50 of 100 cases. (_Percent_ means _of hundred_) 50% or 50 of 100 in math is 50 / 100 = 0.5. Since the options heads or tails exclude each other but one of the both will occur definitly the sum of the probabilities is 100% or 1.\nWhat we want to know is the so called _expectancy value_. For this purpose we have to multiply the occurrence probability with the payout in euros - 0 or 10 euros. The expectancy value of heads is 0.5 x 10 = 5. The expectancy value of tails is 0.5 x 0 = 0. The expectancy value of game 1, the coin flipping, is the sum ob these both single expectancy values, therefore 5 + 0 = 0.\n But what does this result mean? At a single coin flip the probability to get 10,- euros or nothing ist fifty-fifty. The possiblity to get 5,- euros doesn't exist. But the more often the coin is flipped the more the _average_ of the results will approach the number 5."

So the expectancy value of this possiblity is 5. We should choose the possiblity with the highest expectancy value, of course. In our tool the situation looks like this:"

          "text_2": "The expectancy value is now (0.53 x 12) + (0.47 x -2) = 5.42. Therefore at a price of 5,- euros we should play. It will pay off, at least at many bouts."

What shall we do?\nFor the decision the absolute value of the disbursement is actually not decisive, it is the relation of the values to each other. It does not change the result if we double the disbursements and the price of the game. We can use this fact by assigning points to the scenarios: positive points for things we want and negative points for things we don't want. If we are indifferent we assign 0 points. The more we want something or do not want something the more positive or negative points a scenario gets. Here you have to play with the values until they represent your own assessment.\nYou should take probabilities from serious studies. We give you some links. We want you to play with the values. But stay realistic for not cheating yourself. Take care that you not only see what you want to see.\nThe next screen shows the coin flipping games. When you understood the principle you can not only play with the values but modify or add complete new scenarios.\nIf you go to the cover page or the menu you can have a look at the corona vaccination decision. An of course you can use the tool for something completly different and conceive own decision trees: measles vaccination, the color of your wall or the next investment decision in your company.
